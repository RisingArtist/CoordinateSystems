# CoordinateSystems
For learning about local and world spaces in C++ with Vectors and Matrices

The main takeaways from this project:
+ Getting back to C++
+ Hopefully, good programming design practice
+ Making vector and 3x3 Matrices operations in C++
+ Understanding how to convert from one space to another eg. local -> world & world -> local.
